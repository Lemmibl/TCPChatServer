* Add connect(maybe disconnect?) code to SocketWrapper. Rename SocketWrapper to something better..?
* Send UserData every time you change something. Have ClientSidebar have a std::function<void(void)> callback object that points to a relevant ClientScreen function that will make a userpacket.
* Go over all the socket stuff and make it cross platform
