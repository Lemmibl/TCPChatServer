I use the following libraries:
* CEGUI     -> http://cegui.org.uk/
* GLFW      -> http://www.glfw.org/
* Libconfig -> http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/

I also use code from the following people:
* Christian Schladetsch's Event code -> http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/10/30/c-events/

If I have missed anyone it's purely by accident. If you find anything that doesn't seem to be my code, don't hesitate to contact me.
