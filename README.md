TCPChatServer
=============

Simple C++ chat application using BSD sockets to send data over TCP. It's indended to be cross-platform, but I haven't had time to try it for Linux/Mac yet. The long-term goal for this project is to establish a solid cross-platform base/menu system to begin building my Engine 2.0 from. Hence, don't be surprised if you find things in here that might seem overkill for a basic chat application.
